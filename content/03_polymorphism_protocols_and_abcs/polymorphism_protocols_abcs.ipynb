    "1. Learned what polymorphism is, and seen some simple polymorphism examples in python \n",
    "1. We've learned that polymorphism in python is achieved through a simple mechanism known as _duck-typing_\n",
    "1. We've learned that protocols are informal contracts about how objects can be used - often that means which functions these objects must have\n",
    "1. We've learned what Abstract Base Classes (ABCs) are\n",
    "  1. motivation to use ABCs to make sure classes conform to a protocol\n",
    "  1. how to create new ABCs to capture a protocol\n",
    "  1. checking if a class conforms to a protocol by using isinstance with an ABC\n",
    "  1. registering classes that did not inherit from an ABC - virtual subclassing"
