# 

# ## 1. load the data
# 1. extract the column names from the description and read the csv while supplying the columns names
#    - rename columns with a hyphen `-` to use underscores `_` insead. example: `capital-gain --> capital_gain`
#    - look at the head()
# 2. look at info, dtype, check for nan values
# 3. what are the value counts of the categorical variables: workclass, education, marital_status, occupation, relationship, race, sex, native_country, income?
#    - do you notice the extra space ' ' at the beginning of each value?
#    - remove the extra space
# 4. turn 'sex' and 'income' into 0/1 fields
#    - replace the categorical 'sex' column with a numerical 'female' column with value 1 for females and 0 for males
#    - replace the categorical 'income' column with a numerical 'over50k' column with value 1 for '>50k' and 0 for '<50K'
# 5. use `.describe()` function to get descriptive statistics for most columns
#    - make sure that 'sex' and 'over50k' are now numerical fields

# ## 2. explore capital gains / losses
# ### capital_gain
# 1. plot the histogram for capital gains
#    - verbally describe what you see
# 2. for people who have `capital_gain > 0` 
#    - plot the histogram for capital gains
# 3. how many people have capital gains over 25000?
#    - use `value_counts()` to look at all the values of capital_gain over 25000. 
#    - what's weird about the data?
# 4. could the people who had capital_gain==25124 be related?
# 5. does capital_gain over 50k mean income is over 50k?
# 
# ### capital_loss
# 1. plot the histogram of capital_loss
# 2. for people who have `capital_loss > 0` 
#    - plot the histogram for capital_loss
# 3. how many people had both `capital_gain>0` and `capital_loss>0` ?
# 4. who can afford to lose money on capital investments?
#    - what percent of people overall had over 50K income? 
#    - what percent of people with 0 capital_loss? with capital_loss>0?
# 
# ### combining and binning
# 1. create a new `capital_change` column that equals `capital_gain - capital_loss`
# 2. use the `qcut` function to quantize/bin/cut `capital_change` into a new columns called `capital_change_bin` with 10 bins of equal proportions.
#    1. do not bin `capital_change==0` values as there are too many of them
#    2. to simplify using this column later, use the left side of the interval created as the label
#    3. label rows with `capital_change==0` as having `capital_change_bin=0`
#    4. make sure you have no null values for `capital_change_bin`
# 3. how many people have a non-zero capital_change? 
#    - lets call this 'has_capital_change'
#    - plot 'has_capital_change' over 'over50k'
#    - what do you learn from this diagram
# 4. plot `capital_change` by `over50k`
#    - what do you learn from this diagram
# 4. plot `over50k` by `capital_change_bin`
#    - what can you learn from this diagram?
#    

# ## education
# 1. what is the mean education_num by education? 
#   - sort the education categories by the mean_values. does it make sense
#   - check out other descriptive statistics to see if anything falls out of place
#   - turn education into a categorical ordered type
#   - plot education VS education_num
#   - what have we learned?
# 1. plot the distribution for `education`
# 2. plot over50k by education
#    - what can we learn?
# 3. plot hours_per_week by education
#    1. what can we learn from this plot?
#    2. now use the hue="over50k" of seaborn to see hours_per_week by education/over50k.
#       - learn anything else?
# 4. plot education_num by occupation
#   - sort by mean education_num
# 4. plot education_num by workclass
#   - sort by mean education_num
# 5. create a crosstab or a pivot_table of education VS occupation.
#    - normalize it by the education rows 
#      (each row X shows the conditional probability of having occupation Y by education level X) 
#    - create a heatmap that shows which occpupations are most likely for each education level
#    - verbally describe what you've learned
# 6.  create a crosstab or a pivot_table of education VS workclass.
#    - normalize it by the education rows 
#      (each row X shows the conditional probability of having workclass Y by education level X) 
#    - create a heatmap that shows which workclass is most likely for each education level
#    - verbally describe what you've learned
#    - re-run this analysis without the private sector
# 7. plot "race" vs "education_num
# 8. plot "relationship" vs "education_num

# ## occupation / workclass
# 1. how many levels of occupation?
# 2. how many levels of worklass?
# 3. how many combinations? potential? actual?
# 4. plot `over50k` by `occupation`
#    - sort by mean `over50k`
#    - compare this to `over50k` by `education`. which variable more strongly predicts income?
#    - compare this to `education_num` by `occupation`. are the highest paying jobs correlated with highest earning education?
# 5. plot `over50k` by `workclass`
# 6. look at combinations of occupation / workclass
#    1. what are the top combinations in terms of earning over50k (mean)? how many people in that category?
#    2. how many of these combinations have more than 100 people?
#    3. show a heatmap of the mean over50k of occupation-vs-worklass for combinations with more than 100 people. 
#       center the heatmap at the populations mean over50k for increased effect.
#       what conclusions can you draw?
# 7. create a numerical encoding for occupation / workclass pairs
#    - create a new column called "occ_class" that combines the string of the occupation and workclass
#    - use the library [category_encoders](http://contrib.scikit-learn.org/categorical-encoding/), here's an [intro](https://towardsdatascience.com/smarter-ways-to-encode-categorical-data-for-machine-learning-part-1-of-3-6dca2f71b159) how to do it
#    - use the weight of evidence encoder `ce.woe.WOEEncoder` here's an [article](https://towardsdatascience.com/all-about-categorical-variable-encoding-305f3361fd02#targetText=Weight%20of%20Evidence%20Encoding,-Weight%20of%20Evidence&targetText=Weight%20of%20evidence%20(WOE)%20is%20a%20measure%20of%20how%20much,P(Bads)%20%3D%201.) explaining it
#    - add the encoded occ_class as a new column called `occ_class_woe` to your dataframe
#       

# ## correlations
# 1. which features are most important, which correlate?
#     - compute the correction matrix of features with themselves
# 2. draw a clustermap or heatmap of this correlation
#    - center the cluster at 0
#    - annotate the plot with the correlation values
# 3. look at the strongest correlations and draw some conclusions.
#     

# ## TODO:
# 1. look at `relationship` and `marriage_status`. how meaningful are they? should we encode them?
# 2. look at `native_country`. how does immigration effect other variables? should we build further categories based on continent or on 1st/2nd/3rd world countries? should we add an `is_immigrant` boolean column?
# 3. we've done the analysis treating each row of the data as a person, when **in fact** each row represents a large group of people, with the variable `fnlwgt` counting how many people are in the group. redo some of the analysis with weighted averages
# 4. look further at age. should we cut this continous variable into age groups like 18-25, 25-40 etc ?
#    - combine age/relationship to see if relationship effects can be explained away by age
# 4. `education_num` seems to be a label encoding of `education`. I think some degrees are not properly captured with that encoding, like `assoc-voc`. it would be interesting to to recode it with woe against `over50k` and see if anything changes. 
# 5. data quality questions: 
#    - why are women under-represented in this data
#    - why are there no hispanic/latin category in race?
# 6. compare to other interesting analysis:
#    - Predicting Earning Potential using the Adult Dataset https://rpubs.com/H_Zhu/235617
#    - related notebook on kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/adult-census-income
